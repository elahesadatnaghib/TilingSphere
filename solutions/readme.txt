n3002.txt

is 10 optimization of 300 electrons’ potential with random initialization of uniform phi and theta

n3001.txt

is 10 optimization of 300 electrons’ potential with the first electron of each run initialized on the place of previously evaluated 10 electrons on the sphere with minimal potential


n2003.txt

solve for n=100, then fix the solution and solve for the next 100. (eliminate the first col)

n10003.txt

like above with n = 500

n2004.txt

similar to n2003.txt, with one over squared r potential instead of one over r

n2005.txt

similar to above, with one over r^4 : not good
