A telescope covers a circular area of the sky in each observation. Let the total number of the observations be limited to N. The objective of a survey telescope is to scan the sky such that the coverage is well distributed. For the LSST, α = 1.75 deg and N = 3 × 106. The variables of the problem are (1) location of the center of each tile (xi,yi,zi), i = 1...N (2) weight of the tile Wl ≤ wi ≤ Wu, i = 1 . . . N (the amount of the time that the telescope stays in that location.) 

We use an indirect formulation of the problem in which a Riesz s-potential is being minimized. The solution is a uniform configuration of the points on the sphere which we use as the center of tiling (figure on the top). Figure in the middle shows a same number of tiles with uniformly random configuration and the bottom is a deterministic HealPix configuration that is the newest approach for this application.
